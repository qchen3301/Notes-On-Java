# Notes-On-Java
Much learn (wow) so study

---
## Boilerplate Purpose  
This repo and its files will host my self-study on Java, to be used later as reference material, or 
a quick 'how-to' guide for working with IDEs such as Eclipse or IntelliJ, while doubling as good practice to keep my understanding of Git commands up to date. I will be primarily referencing the textbook 'Starting Out With Java' (6th Ed) by Tony Gaddis. Any additional reference material (blogposts, how-to guides) will be documented in the Acknowledgements/References subheader.
